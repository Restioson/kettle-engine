## About
This project aims to be a Kotlin game engine with Kotlin "content packages", which add content

## Documentation
We have a [wiki](https://github.com/Restioson/kettle-engine/wiki). We also host [Dokka documentation](https://restioson.github.io/docs/kettle-engine/) on [Restioson's site](https://restioson.github.io). You can also compile the Dokka documentation your self by running `dokka` Gradle task

## A Note on Future Compatibility
As the project's basis is still actively changing, future compatability cannot be ensured. After the project leaves the WIP stage, there should be compatability over the feature version numbers (x.X.x), and certainly over the patch version numbers (x.x.X). Increments to the major version number, (X.x.x) mean that the api has changed.

## Contributing
