## A Note on Future Compatibility
As the project's basis is still actively changing, future compatability cannot be ensured. After the project leaves the WIP stage, there should be compatability over the feature version numbers (x.X.x), and certainly over the patch version numbers (x.x.X). Increments to the major version number, (X.x.x) mean that the api has changed.

## WIP
- 3D
- More implementations
- More API
- Server Multiplayer
- Serialization/saving
- Prebuilt docs
